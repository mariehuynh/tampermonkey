Tampermonkey Scripts
============
This is a collection of Tampermonkey scripts that I wrote to make the internet better and save me time.  

* **AmazonHistory** - Inserts a button on product pages that links to their price history (I'm currently using camelcamelcamel).

* **GSX Sale** - There's no filter on the site to show only the things that are on sale.  This adds a button that provides that filter.  Note: this does not deal with the pagination so if there's nothing on sale on the page, it will hide everything.

* **SafewayCoupon** - They offer almost 400 coupons at a time but I didn't want to sift through what might be useful.  So this adds all of them to my card in case it comes in handy.

* **Pinterest** - So you liked a bunch of things but don't want to click on all 300 items to sort them into boards?  Want to clear the whole "likes" page?  This gives you two buttons: 
 * "Pin All" will click on all the "Pin It" buttons for you but you still get to choose which board and add a description for each one.
 * "Toggle All Hearts" will click on all the hearts for you.  Any that are on will turn off; off will turn on.  You can click it more than once to toggle it back but be careful to only leave or reload the page when you are sure you like the state of things because pinterest will forget any that are off!

* **OKCVisitorFilter** - Want a list of high matches who have checked you out?  This hides everyone from your "Visitors" page who is less than an 80% match.  Go ahead.  Have high standards.  You deserve someone awesome.

Note: These sites change often, which may break these scripts.  Please let me know if something has stopped working.
